        Interest rates have increased over the past year. Here's what this means for students:
        
        * **Student Loans**: Variable rate private loans may see payment increases
        * **Savings Accounts**: Higher interest rates on savings (a good thing!)
        * **Credit Cards**: Higher interest on unpaid balances - try to pay in full each month
        * **Job Market**: Can impact hiring in some sectors as companies adjust spending
        
        **Action Item**: Now is a good time to check if your savings account is offering a competitive interest rate.
